* John Green
  - People were not aware they were "living in history."
  - Renaissance affected only a small portion of the population (mostly the rich)
  - We think the Renaissance is important because it gives a narrative and matters to us in the present.
  - 95% of population did not know about the Renaissance
  - Renaissance occurred over hundreds of years.
  - Was a lot of independent events happening over a long period of time.
* Amor Sciendi
  - Rebuttal to Aristotle not changing European lives: Universities based on philosophy established after discovery of Aristotelian texts.
  - Universities influenced laws and new job opportunities.
  - People do not have to be aware of something existing for it to exist
  - Some people (ex. Lorenzo Valla, Petrarch) did know and write about the Renaissance occurring
  - Rebuttal to Renaissance being a narrative: That doesn't make it any less validated.
  - Some movements are slow
