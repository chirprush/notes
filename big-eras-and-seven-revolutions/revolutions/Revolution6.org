** Conflict
   
   - In modern times, conflict is usually found with terrorism, and not between countries.
   - Terrorist groups have evolved into organized groups with resources and capital.
   - Terrorists finance themselves with arms, drug, and human trafficking.
   - As mentioned earlier, disparities in benefits cause social unrest and could be leading factors in encouraging terrorism.
   - Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) are also a large threat in the possession of countries such as North Korea or Iran. They are an even greater threat in the possession of non-governmental bodies.
   - People may be able to obtain nuclear weapon materials on the black market and other places.
   - WMD threats come from both developed and developing countries.
   - Armies need to evolve and change to adapt to their adversaries.
