\textbf{Summary. } \Comment{Joseph K.'s}{I find it interesting that he is
always referred to as K. rather than Joseph. In addition, we don't actually
learn of his last name.} morning routine is interrupted when he finds two
warders in his apartment (the landlord is a lady called Frau Grubach I think).
One of the men is named \Comment{Franz}{Like Franz Kafka, which is very sus.},
and he tells K. that he is under arrest, and thus cannot leave the room. Franz
does not answer any further questions on why, and profuses that he is merely a
\Comment{lackey}{Already we have some sense of bureaucracy.} whose only job is
to keep K. detained. K. cites the constitution as a reason for why this cannot
be done to him, but he also remarks that he does not know the exact
\Comment{Law}{Capitalized exactly like this in the book.}, to the jest of the
warders.

All the while, a nosy old lady is viewing the sight through a window.

\textbf{Thoughts. } I think the book does a very good job of portraying
confusion. K. initially thinks that the entire situation is a farce, a joke
played by his friends which is a very human initial thought.
