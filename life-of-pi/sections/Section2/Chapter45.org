* Chapter 45
  As day breaks out again, Pi finds hope in and believes that, this day, he will be rescued. Peering into the boat, Pi sees that the hyena attacked the zebra at some point, biting off its broken leg.

  Pi shifts his position on the oar, moving closer to the hyena, and is able to see the orangutan. Pi notes its human-like seasickness and lack of injury.

  A sea turtle then appears, bumping into the boat. Pi says that he would befriend this species later on. After a few minutes, the turtle leaves.
