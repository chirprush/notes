* Chapter 66
  In this chapter, Pi details more of his fishing accolades.
  
  Pi quickly becomes more accustomed to hunting fish, using strategies such as wounding their gills so that they swim up and disguising the fishing hook with a net covered with seaweed.
  
  Pi also details his struggle in catching turtles. Although they are slow and easy to stop, Pi found difficulty in hauling them onto the ship due to their near insurmountable weight.
  
  Pi once again reflects on his actions, labelling himself as a savage.
