* Chapter 44
  As the sun sets and night falls, Pi loses vision of what is going on. Fearing that the hyena will go after him, Pi tries to stay on the very edge of the boat. Although the animals make sounds, the boat does not move, and Pi is not harmed.
  
  Eventually the night passes.

  *Question: How long will Pi be able to hold on to the oar? How will he go about acquiring food and clean water?*
