* Chapter 37
  The ship sunk, and Pi was separated from his family. From the lifeboat, Pi saw Richard Parker in the water, on the verge of drowning.

  *Note: Although Richard Parker has been directly referenced a few times throughout the story, it seems that we still do not know much about him. What is his relationship to Pi? When Pi is yelling at him, he says that Parker is a strong swimmer. Perhaps Parker is a friend of Adirubasamy?*

  While refusing to accept the current situation, Pi urges Parker to swim to the boat. After a while of trying, Pi's personality suddenly switches and he tries in vain to force Parker away. Despite this, Parker still makes it onto the boat. Here, we learn that Parker is not a human but rather a three year old adult tiger.
  
  Pi falls overboard in shock as to what he has just done.
