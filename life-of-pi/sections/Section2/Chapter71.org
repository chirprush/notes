* Chapter 71
  Pi outlines his plan that he uses to tame Richard Parker.

  Pi blows his whistle to stir up Richard Parker and bait him into entering his "territory." After Richard Parker sets foot into this space, Pi increases his volume in order to show Richard Parker that he is very territorial.
  
  Pi then controls the lifeboat to increase the waves and thus the seasickness of Richard Parker. By doing this and repeating the steps, Richard Parker gradually associates the whistle with severe nausea and seasickness. Pi then makes sure that Richard Parker does not sustain harm from the seasickness.
  
  In this way, Pi can control the behavior of Richard Parker.
