* Chapter 49
  Pi has not had food or water for the past three days. Pi's thinking begins to slow, and he has trouble moving. Because of this, Pi, having nothing to lose, crawls inward on the boat, searching for water.
  
  Pi also reflects on the past behaviors of the animals, now making much more sense due to the presence of Richard Parker.
