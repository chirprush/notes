* Chapter 78
  Pi describes the plentiful different sceneries present in the sky and sea.
  
  Pi also makes a few connections to his life as a castaway.

  Pi believes that "[t]o be a castaway is to be a point perpetually at the centre of a circle" (78.5). Pi says that, although the colors and the brightness changes, the shape stays the same. He is also constantly between the sun and the moon, both circles.
  
  Pi also believes that being a castaway entails experiencing many extreme opposites: the bright, scalding, dryness of the day and the dark, shivering, dampness of the night. Pi also describes the opposites of boredom and terror, which play with the mind.
  
  Pi relates his situation to an endgame in chess. The pieces are simple and few, but there is much risk.
