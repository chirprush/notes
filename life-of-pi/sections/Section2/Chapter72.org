* Chapter 72
  This chapter details Pi's initial struggle in taming Richard Parker.

  Pi confronts Richard Parker with a heavy turtle shell as a shield. As he begins to make noise, Richard Parker swipes his paw at Pi, knocking him off of the lifeboat and into the water. This happens four times in total before Richard Parker succumbs to the whistle.

  Pi explains that he is not harmed because, like most predators, Richard Parker does not actually want to engage in fights that could be deadly.
