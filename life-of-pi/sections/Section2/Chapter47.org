  Despite its injuries, the zebra is still alive but barely able to move. The other two animals are both on edge.
  
  The zebra dies a few hours later in the afternoon. The hyena charges the orangutan, but the orangutan hits it on the head. Pi feels instilled with hope, but he knows that the orangutan cannot win against the hyena. The hyena beheads the orangutan and faces Pi. Before thowing himself on the hyena, Pi looks down, sees Richard Parker, and collapses.
