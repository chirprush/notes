* Chapter 90
  Both Richard Parker and, eventually, Pi lose their vision.

  As Pi resigns himself to death and lies down, he hears what he believes to be Richard Parker talking to him. Shortly after, Pi realizes that the voice is coming from another stranded person on another lifeboat. They discuss about food and other matters for a while with Pi referring to the person as "Brother."
  
  After talking, the two try to find each other in their mutual blindness and converse a bit more, telling stories and dreaming of food. Eventually, they tether the boats together.
  
  As the two meet and embrace, the man puts his hands on Pi's throat, planning on killing Pi for food. Before Pi can warn him, however, Richard Parker claws the man, killing him.
