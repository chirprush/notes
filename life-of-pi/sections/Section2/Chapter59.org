* Chapter 59
  Pi notices that, with the raft acting as an anchor, the lifeboat has switched directions. This works out for Pi because it intensifies Richard Parker's seasickness.
  
  As Pi returns to the lifeboat for supplies, he observes a party of cockroaches jumping off the lifeboat to their death, leaving only Pi and Richard Parker to be left on the boat.
  
  Pi enters the tarpaulin and, upon seeing a pool of rainwater, drinks it to preserve what he has left. 

  Pi then begins work on the raft, adding a second rope, creating a mast and canopy, and installing solar stills.
  
  While the sun sets, Pi observes the wide variety and density of life in the ocean.
