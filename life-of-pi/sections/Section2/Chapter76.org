* Chapter 76
  Pi describes his routine of cleaning up after Richard Parker's excrement. Pi explains that this was done to prevent infection as well as assert dominance over Richard Parker. Because Richard Parker hides it from Pi, Pi can sense that the tiger is intimidated by him.
  
  Pi laments that, due to low water and high protein intake, both Richard Parker and him are constipated.
