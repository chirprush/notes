* Chapter 80
  One day, during a storm of flying fish, Pi catches a dorado on the lifeboat with a gaff. Pi, delighted, finds himself approached by Richard Parker, who also seems to want the dorado.
  
  Pi and Richard Parker stare each other down, and, to Pi's surprise, Richard Parker relents. With this, Pi feels that he has tamed Richard Parker.
  
  With this knowledge, Pi gradually stays on the lifeboat for longer and becomes used to being around the tiger.
