* Chapter 42
  "Orange Juice," the orangutan, floats in the direction of the boat, standing on a net covered with spiders and bananas. As the orangutan makes its way onto the boat, the net begins to sink. Pi picks up the net, which is hinted to be useful later on in the future, but does not manage to pick up the bananas, which he regrets later on.
  
  Still being quite confused with the situation, the orangutan lays on the tarpaulin of the boat for a minutes before falling onto the body of the lifeboat. This beckons a scream from the hyena.
