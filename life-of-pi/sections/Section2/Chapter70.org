* Chapter 70
  Pi manages to bring the turtle onto the lifeboat without bothering Richard Parker. As the survival manual suggests, Pi cuts its neck artery and collects the blood that comes out of it, only amounting to a can's worth.

  In order to stop it from moving, Pi tries to cut off the head of the turtle, which does not work. Pi then decides to give the remaining body of the turtle to Richard Parker as food.
  
  Pi, disappointed with the amount of work that he has to do in order to get such a measly amount of blood, thinks about how to best handle Richard Parker from now on.
  
  Pi ends the chapter by saying, "It was time to impose myself and carve out my territory" (70.7).

*Inference: From this quote, we can most likely tell that Pi will try to further tame Richard Parker and establish his own territory in an effort to make Richard Parker respect him.*
