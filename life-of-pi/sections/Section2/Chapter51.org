* Chapter 51
  In search of water and food, Pi moves inward towards the boat, concocting a plan to get under the tarpaulin without Richard Parker noticing. Eventually, Pi finds a locker containing canned water and packages of food.
  
  Using the hooks of the tarpaulin to open the can, Pi drinks four containers of water and feels invigorated. Pi then begins to feel hungry. He opens a package of biscuits, which are made out of wheat, animal fat, and sugar.
  
  Pi takes record of the contents of the locker. There are thirty-one containers of food left, each meant to last three days. This equates to 93 days worth of food. Pi also has enough water to last at least 124 days.
