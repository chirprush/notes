* Chapter 62
  In this chapter, Pi tackles the problem of Richard Parker's, as well as his own, thirst.
  
  After pondering for a bit, Pi turns towards the solar stills with doubt. To his surprise, all of them were full of fresh water, totaling around eight liters.
  
  Pi drinks one container's worth and gives the rest, with some salt water added, to Richard Parker. During this, Pi realizes that the lifeboat has turned into a miniature zoo.
  
  Pi tries his luck at catching more fish but does not succeed.
  
  At the end of the chapter, Pi states that the next morning will mark exactly one week after his ship, the /Tsimtsum/, sunk.
