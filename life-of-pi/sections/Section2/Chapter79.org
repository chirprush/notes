* Chapter 79
  Pi retells his experience with sharks on the lifeboat.

  The sharks, mostly consisting of makos, blue sharks, and oceanic whitetips, do not bother Pi or the lifeboat for the most part.

  Pi begins to catch some sharks for food. The first shark he catches is a mako. Pi flings it onto the lifeboat and into Richard Parker's territory. There, Richard Parker claws at it, and the shark bites into his paw. The two creatures fight, and while Richard Parker is victorious, he does sustain some temporary damage.
  
  After that experience, Pi starts catching smaller sharks.
