* Chapter 89
  Pi describes the salt and sun induced decaying of everything: the lifeboat, clothes and blankets, Richard Parker, and Pi.

  Pi and Richard Parker lose large amounts of weight and mostly pass the days by resting for long periods. Pi writes his last diary entry due to running out of pens.
