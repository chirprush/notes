* Chapter 65
  [[./img/equatorial_countercurrent.png]]

  Pi laments his lack of knowledge of navigation, wind currents, and marining in general. He does not know where or how to guide the boat, so he drifts, going along with the winds.
  
  At the end of the chapter, future Pi mentions that he was travelling along the Pacific equatorial counter-current, highlighted in the picture.

  *Question: Going based off of the map, will Pi end up somewhere in Central America?*
