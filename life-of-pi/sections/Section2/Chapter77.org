* Chapter 77
  As Pi's original rations begin to run out, he resorts to eating less, but this only increases his hunger. Pi relishes the sea life that he catches and begins to eat them more desperately. During this time, Pi develops a strong dislike towards salt.

  Pi is gradually driven to a point of almost madness where he tries to eat the feces of Richard Parker. It holds no nutritional value, and Pi spits it out.
  
  Eventually, parts of Pi's body, especially his legs, begin to decay.
