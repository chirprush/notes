* Chapter 57
  As Pi is on the raft, Richard Parker lets out a sound called prusten, which "expresses friendliness and harmless intentions" (57.5). Pi is surprised and realizes that he can assert dominance over Richard Parker and tame him like a circus trainer would.

  Pi acts out and yells lines like a circus trainer while blowing a whistle. This irritates Richard Parker and succeeds in pushing him back.

  Instead of waiting out the tiger's health, Pi decides that he will change the plan and keep Richard Parker alive. Pi says that he actually does not want Richard Parker to die because he would then be left alone to face despair.
