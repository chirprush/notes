* Chapter 46
  Pi begins to lose hope of rescue, telling the reader that this night was one of his worst nights ever. On the boat, Pi notices that the orangutan, Orange Juice, has an expression that shows it has committed to death.
  
  After the hyena wakes up and moves, it eats the zebra, ripping off its skin and eating its insides. The orangutan, startled, gets up and begins to roar. The hyena roars in response. The zebra's blood also attracted sharks, who hit the boat. Despite this situation, nothing happens.
  
  After the sun sets, Pi finally accepts that help is not coming and that his family is dead.
