* Chapter 41
  In order to get a better vantage point, Pi cautiously pulls himself up onto the boat. Although he does not see any other lifeboats or survivors, he does survey the situation of the boat. 

  The zebra is lying on the floor with a broken leg, but still living, to the surprise of Pi who thought it would have been eaten by the tiger. Pi then looks past the zebra and sees a hyena. Pi surmises that the hyena was always there, the tiger must have fallen off, and that the crew who threw him overboard earlier were not doing so to save him but instead to use him as bait.
  
  The weather then clears as the day begins.
