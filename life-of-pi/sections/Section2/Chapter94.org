* Chapter 94
  The lifeboat comes ashore in Mexico. Much to Pi's disappointment, Richard Parker leaps off the boat and heads to the jungle without much acknowledgment of Pi and without a formal goodbye.
  
  After a few hours, people find Pi and take care of him, cleaning him, feeding him, giving him clothes, taking him to a hospital, and eventually getting him a foster parent, leading to his university life.
  
  Pi expresses thanks to all of the people who made his life possible.
