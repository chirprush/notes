  At first, the journey of the ship was fine. The ship made its way safely to Manila, where it stopped for animal feed, cargo, and ship maintenance. Pi watched the animals, but Ravi watched the men working on the ship. Ravi told Pi that there was something wrong with the engine.
  
  A little while after they set sail again, Pi heard an explosion in the early morning. Pi tried to wake up Ravi to no avail and thought better than to wake up his parents, so he went to explore alone.
  
  Pi made his way upstairs to the main deck and found that there was some light rain. As Pi looked around, he did not see anything out of the ordinary except for the lifeboat being out of place. The ship was tilting. Pi felt the need to go back.
  
  After going down one level, he saw that it was full of water. Despite his family being below, he rushed upstairs to safety. Pi realized the ship was sinking and began looking for other people, while running into animals.
  
  Pi ran to where the officers would be, but did not find anyone. There were, however, three crew members. As Pi tried to talk to them, he was handed a life jacket and tossed overboard.
