* Chapter 43
  Pi holds out hope that rescue ships or other vessels will soon come to rescue his family and him. Pi then explains the situation on the boat.
  
  The zebra generally lies still throughout the duration of the chapter. The hyena, however, does anything but. It runs in circles around the boat, resting only at a few periodic intervals. Although the hyena comes close, it does not interact with Pi, who is on edge, both figuratively and literally.

  Pi explains the true nature of a hyena. Although they look cowardly and air-headed during the day, they become true hunters at night, ganging up on any prey they can find. Pi also explains that hyenas have little to no morals, eating or doing anything that they please, limited only by their jaw strength.

  At the end of the chapter, the hyena stops and lays down near the zebra.
