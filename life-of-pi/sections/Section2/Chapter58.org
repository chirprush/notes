* Chapter 58
  Pi reads the survival manual, which contains some basic tips for surviving after a shipwreck.
  
  Afterwards, Pi sets out a few tasks to complete for himself:
  
  - Train Richard Parker.
  - Start fishing food for Richard Parker.
  - Create a canopy for the raft.
  - Tie a second rope from the lifeboat to the raft.
  - Improve the raft.
  - Stop blindly hoping and be more active.

  At the end of the chapter, Pi cries, thinking that his situation is quite grim.
