* Chapter 100
  The last chapter contains the report published by Mr. Okamoto.
  
  In the report, Okamoto details the information Pi gave him regarding the sinking of the ship.
  
  At the end of the report, Okamoto writes about the strength and courage of Pi, including a reference, surprisingly, to Pi's original story through the mention of "an adult Bengal tiger" (100.5).
