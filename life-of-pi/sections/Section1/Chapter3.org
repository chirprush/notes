* Chapter 3
  One of the main character's father's business acquaintances by the name of Francis Adirubasamy, nicknamed Mamaji, was a friend of the family. This is the same man introduced in the author's note. The main character's brother, Ravi, used to joke about Adirubasamy's physical appearance, relating it to his love of swimming. Adirubasamy tried to teach swimming to the main character's family, but no one, besides the main character, was willing to learn. Eventually the main character went to the pool to practice and developed a love for swimming.

  The main character then mentions Adirubasamy's ventures to Paris for studying. He then mentions the many pools that Adirubasamy visited during his time there, such as the Piscine Deligny, Piscine Ch√¢teau-Landon, Pisicine Rouvet, and others. Adirubasamy's favorite, however, was Piscine Molitor.

  Because of Adirubasamy's love for it, the main character's name is _Piscine Molitor Patel_.
