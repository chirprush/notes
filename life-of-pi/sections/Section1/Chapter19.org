* Chapter 19
  Pi went back to the bread shop owner and inquired about his religion. When asked what it was about, the owner responded that "'It is about the Beloved,' [...]" (19.3). Pi realized that Islam was about brotherhood and devotion.

  Pi then recounted his positive experience of praying with the rest of the worshippers.
