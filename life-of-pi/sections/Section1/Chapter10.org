* Chapter 10
  Some zoo animals try to escape, not /to somewhere/, but rather /from something/. As earlier mentioned, animals are very susceptible to change, and the slightest inconvenience may cause them to try and leave. Even animals natively born in the zoo have some innate instinct to try to escape if their conditions are not met.

  Regardless, many animals do not escape because, once again, they hate change, and the conditions out in the wild are unknown.
