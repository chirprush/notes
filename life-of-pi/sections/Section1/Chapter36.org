* Chapter 36
  This chapter is again in the "time leap" style.
  
  This time, the narrator goes into Pi's house, meeting his son, Nikhil, his daughter, Usha, his dog, Tata, and his cat, Moccasin. This chapter almost confirms that the narrator is the author when Nikhil says, "'Dad! The writer's here'" (36.3).
  
  The narrator tries talking to Usha, who is shy and hides behind Pi's leg. Pi explains that Usha is four years old. Pi plays with her, causing her to laugh, ending the chapter happily.
