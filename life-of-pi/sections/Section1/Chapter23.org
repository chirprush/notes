* Chapter 23
  On one day, three people of high status from the Christian, Hindu, and Islam communities went to see Pi and his family. Pi, not having told his family or others that he was practicing three religions, was worried. Pi's father was not religious at all, and his mother was likely neutral. As the three men approached Pi and realized the others, they were confused and somewhat angry. While the parents were also surprised, they did not seem to be angry. The three began to argue over their religions. As Pi's father tried to calm them down, Pi was forced to speak up. Pi quoted Gandhi in saying that "all religions are true" and that he wanted to love God. Not being able to argue with a well-meaning child, the three men backed off.
