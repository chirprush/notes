* Chapter 34
  This chapter details the selling of the zoo, the main preparation for the family's trip to Canada.
  
  The animals were mostly sold to other zoos all across the United States, but a select few ended up in Canada. Pi details that moving the animals and trading them involved extensive paperwork and caused quite a bit of stress for his father.
  
  Along the way, Pi and Ravi felt that they did not want to move to Canada.
  
  Pi was first introduced to Americans when they came to inspect the condition of the animals.
