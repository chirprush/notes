* Chapter 8
  The chapter starts by stating that the most dangerous animals in a zoo are humans. Pi details this by recounting the many idiotic acts that people have done in zoos all around the world, such as feeding animals foreign objects like bottles, poisoning them, and fighting or harming them.

  Pi's father, however, also believed there to be another, far more dangerous behavior: anthropomorphizing animals or treating them like they could be friends. To teach this lesson to Pi and Ravi, their father showed a hungry tiger viciously tearing into a goat in front of their eyes. The father then went on to explain that other animals, such as hippos, hyenas, ostriches, deer, camels, birds, and elephants are equally dangerous and should be treated with care.
  
  The main idea to take away from the father's lesson is that *"[l]ife will defend itself no matter how small it is"* (8.85).
