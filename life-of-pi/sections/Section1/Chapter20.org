* Chapter 20
  Pi described the owner's relationship and devotion to God as personal and loving. Pi remarked this as a bit interesting because the owner's name, Satish Kumar, was the same name of his Communist, athiest biology teacher. Pi accredited his love of zoology and his love of religion to the two Satish Kumars.
  
  Pi felt the presence of and a deep connection to God while praying at the owner's shop. Pi had this same feeling later in Canada. After snow had fallen during the night, Pi had to trek his way up to a house during the day. As he ventured towards it, he saw movement and looked around. In front of his eyes, he envisioned the kind, loving Virgin Mary. Pi felt rewarded with the presence of God.
