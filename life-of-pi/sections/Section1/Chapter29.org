* Chapter 29
  Pi outlines the chapter by stating at the beginning that people move out of hope for better conditions.
  
  Pi, who did not care much for current events at the time, explains the political struggles of the time period that caused his father and mother a great deal of worry. The Tamil Nadu government, a major critic of Mrs. Gandhi, had been taken down, marking the ever approaching dictorial takeover.
  
  Pi explains that "bad politics is bad for business" (29.7). The zoo was not making much money as is, so the changing of rights and removal of democracy only served to worsen the situation.
  
  Pi then reiterates on the first paragraph by explaining that people move out of anxiety.

  Soon, Pi's parents told Ravi and him that they would be moving to Canada, a country almost on the other side of the world.
