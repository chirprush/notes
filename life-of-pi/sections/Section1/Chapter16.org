* Chapter 16
  The start of the chapter opens with Pi explaining how he was taken to a Hindu temple at a very young age and how he was interested in Hinduism and religion ever since that time. Pi felt a strong tie to Hinduism, feeling a "presence" and a connection to it.
  
  Pi then explains the Hindu persepective of the world, with the concepts of Brahman, reincarnation, karma, and liberation. At the end of it, Pi interestingly says that, despite how much devotion one has, they must not be too attached to God.
  
  The chapter ends with Pi recalling an anecdote of someone mishearing "Hare Krishnas" as "Hairless Christians." Pi mentions this to reflect that it is not even wrong, and that many people, such as Muslims, Christians, and Hindus, all have something in common.
