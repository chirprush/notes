* Chapter 33
  This chapter once again features the italic text.
  
  Perhaps continuing from the last "time skip" chapter, the narrator is shown photos of Pi's life. There are pictures from the wedding, honeymoon, his university, and graduation. Interestingly, the narrator remarks, "A smile every time, but his eyes tell another story" (33.1).
  
  There are also photos from Brazil and places over the Pacific, but those pictures were lost. Another picture depicts a major political figure visiting the zoo.
  
  Another picture shows schoolchildren, with Pi pointing one of them out to be Richard Parker.
  
  *Note: Originally, I thought the mysterious narrator was Richard Parker, but this solidifies the fact that it is most likely the author, Yann Martel.*
  
  At the end of the chapter, Pi laments that he cannot remember his mother clearly.
