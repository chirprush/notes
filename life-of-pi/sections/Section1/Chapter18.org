* Chapter 18
  Pi encountered his third religion, Islam, at the age of fifteen. Pi was exploring the Muslim area of his hometown and passed by a mosque. Not daring to enter, Pi instead went past it and went into a poorer district, finding a shop. There, Pi saw some sort of bread or dough and went to inspect it. The owner of the shop then appeared and asked Pi if he would want one. Pi, startled threw the piece of food on the ground. Despite this, the owner asked if he would like another one, to which Pi obliged, and they ate together.
  
  After they finished, the owner started to explain how the bread was made but was interupted by the muezzin, a person who calls upon Muslims to pray. The owner fetched a carpet and began the ceremony right in front of Pi, doing, what seemed to Pi, interesting stretches and exercises.

  This left an impact on Pi, who was left, just like with Christianity, curious.
