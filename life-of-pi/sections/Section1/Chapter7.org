* Chapter 7
  Pi has met a few people in his life that have changed his way of thinking. One of these people was his biology teacher, Satish Kumar. Mr. Kumar, a Communist of odd appearance, was a outward athiest, believing in science and reasoning over anything else. He would frequently come to the zoo to look at the animals.

  One time, he saw Pi and call him over to talk. In a conversation between the two, Pi mentioned religion, and Mr. Kumar responded with "Religion? I don't believe in religion. Religion is darkness" (7.10). When Mr. Kumar was young, he was bedridden with polio. He prayed to God for help, yet no help came. Instead, medicine saved him.

  As time went on, Mr. Kumar became one of Pi's favorite teachers. This caused Pi to realize that athiests are actually "brothers and sisters of a different faith" (7.20). Instead, Pi disliked agnostic people more for their indecisiveness and doubt at the center of their life.
