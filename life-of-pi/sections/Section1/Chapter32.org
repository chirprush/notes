* Chapter 32
  In this chapter, Pi explains the phenomenon of zoomorphism, where animals treat humans or animals of different kinds as their own kin. Pi gives a few examples, such as a rat and vipers coexisting in the zoo until an unaware young cobra bit it as well as the lion cub with a dog mother.

  Pi explains that the reason for zoomorphism is not well known, but he believes that: "the answer lies in something I mentioned earlier, that measure of madness that moves life in strange but saving ways" (32.9).
