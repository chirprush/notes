* Chapter 27
  This chapter details a conversation between Pi's father and mother following the events of Chapter 26.

  The two parents once again reiterate that they do not understand Pi's obsession with religion as they are both very modern. The two then go on to talk about their displeasure with Mrs. Gandhi, who they describe as foolish and something that will pass.
  
  *Note: Here, the parents use a very interesting piece of figurative language, describing India and Pi, in his own way, as "marching to the drumbeat of progress."*
  
  The conversation moves on to the parents criticizing Pi's addressing of Gandhi as "Bapu," which is quite affectionate, as well as his following of Islam. While his father finds Hinduism fine and Christianity tolerable, he does not quite accept Pi becoming a Muslim due to how different they are. In the end, though, the parents give up and label it as hopefully just being a phase.
