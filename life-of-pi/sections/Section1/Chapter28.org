* Chapter 28
  Pi talks about his love of his prayer rug and his peaceful experience praying outside in the yard. Pi would pray in the direction of Mecca with his face to the floor. Sometimes, a member of the family would look at him as they were getting used to the sight.
  
  Pi also recounts his baptism, which his mother and father attended.
