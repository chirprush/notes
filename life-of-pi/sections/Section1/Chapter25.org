* Chapter 25
  Pi laments the state of those that rush to defend God against any sort of disrespectful language. Pi does not believe that God is so fragile to need the outward, public defense of humans. Instead, Pi believes that God needs to be defended on the inside, in people's hearts.

  Pi states that he was chased away from a mosque, glared at by a priest, and shooed away from darshan. After the public finds out that Pi follows three religions, they believe that Pi is betraying them. Pi, on the other hand, does not understand this behavior because chasing him away from religious practices does not do God any good.

  Despite the opposition Pi faces, he still continues to practice all three religions.
