* Chapter 15
  This chapter uses the same italic text and vague mention of "he," who we can assume to be the previously mentioned Richard Parker.
  
  This chapter describes the house of Richard Parker, which is described as a temple. Throughout the house, there are remnants and objects from three different religions: Hinduism, Catholicism, and Islam. Instances of Hinduism can be found with statues and shrines of various gods such as Ganesha, Shiva, and Krishna. Catholicism is represented through a cross, a Bible, and depictions of Christ and the Virgin Mary. Islam is represented through the Arabic writing and a photo of Kaaba.
  
  *Why does this Richard Parker character have these objects? Was he, like Pi, a religious researcher?*
