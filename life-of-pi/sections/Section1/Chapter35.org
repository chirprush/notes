* Chapter 35
  [[./img/madras.png]]
  Pi's family prepared to leave from Madras on June 21st, 1977 on the large cargo ship /Tsimtsum/. As the animals were sedated and loaded on to the ship, the family said their goodbyes to everyone, and the ship started moving. Despite Pi's original hesitancy towards moving, he noted that he was quite excited.
  
  At the end of the chapter, Pi states that "[t]hings didn't turn out the way they were supposed to..." (35.6).
