* Chapter 31
  Pi invited Mr. Kumar, the baker, to the zoo. Worried that he would miss Mr. Kumar for how plain of a person he was, Pi kept on close watch outside the main gate and ignored friends coming his way.
  
  Once they met, Pi waived any payments for him and invited him in. Mr. Kumar was quite fascinated by the animals, liking the zebra in particular. Along the way, they met the other Mr. Kumar, the teacher.
