* Chapter 13
  The main character once again reiterates that, if someone were to fall into, for example, a lion pit, the lion would eat the person, not out of hunger or bloodthirst, but instead out of anxiety and protection of their territory.

  Pi then goes onto show with the example of a circus trainer that animals, such as lions, follow a social hierarchy. Their place in the hierarchy determines their behavior and whether they feel inferior or superior to certain creatures. One way to appear higher in this hierarchy is to intimidate the animal and show that they do not own the territory by being there first. Coupled with loud sounds and such as a whip or a whistle, a lion or any other dangerous animal will likely stay away out of fear and uncertainty. If the lion is not sufficiently intimidated or does not know its place in the hierarchy, it remains alert and dangerous.
