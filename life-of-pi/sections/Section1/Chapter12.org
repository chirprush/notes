* Chapter 12
  Here, the story again (see Chapters 2, 6) vaguely mentions this character, thin, small chef character, but goes on to name him. The person that the chapter is referring to is Richard Parker, whom the reader was introduced to in Chapter 1, with Pi saying that Parker abandoned him.

  *Who really is this man? What is his significance to the plot? Why did he and Pi split ways?*
