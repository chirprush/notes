* Analysis
** Character Development

   For the most part, we see Pi and Richard Parker as the only dynamic characters of the story. For the short while that Pi's family, relatives, friends, and acquaintances appear, we don't quite see a substantial amount of growth or learning compared to Pi. As Pi is an adolescent, this makes sense and might be the reason why this is a popular youth novel.
   
*** Pi's Growth
    
    Pi's growth starts even before the sinking of the /Tsimtsum/ and his ordeal on the lifeboat. In the first part of the story, we see a curious, impressionable, and young version of Pi. Because of these qualities, Pi picks up valuable knowledge from the people around him.

    Pi learns a great deal from his interest in religion, with the teachers of each religion instilling life lessons, hope, and excitement.
    
    At a young age, Pi picks up swimming from a man named Adirubasamy, a friend of his father. Pi gains a respect for the man and is infused with his passion of swimming and love of the ocean.
    
    Because Pi's father is the owner of a zoo, Pi's acquires a love of nature and a deep insight into the thought process and behavior of animals.

    It is clear that much of Pi's encounters in his early life were critical for his later survival on the lifeboat, the setting where much of Pi's growth and maturity comes from.
    
    After the /Tsimtsum/ sinks, Pi is left stranded on a lifeboat with only a few other animals, one being a Bengal tiger. He loses his family in the process and finds that no help comes for in the following days.
    
    In response to his endlessly grim circumstances, Pi still finds hope and does not resign himself to death. Over time and in spite of hardships, Pi builds mental strength and finds a strong will to live. This speaks highly to the fortitude and toughness of his character and hints at quite a deal of reflection.
    
    One particular point in the story where this is apparent is when Pi makes the decision to leave the algae island. Despite the abundance of resources and prospects of survival, Pi pushes forward in search of land instead of living out his days stranded and alone like the person before him. Pi acknowledges that there will be struggle and grief, but he decides to leave anyways. In making such a decision, Pi exhibits an enduring conscience.
    
    In addition to this mental fortitude that he builds, Pi learns essential survival skills in a trial-by-fire sense. Pi experiences what it is like to build shelter, acquire food and water, and fight for survival.

*** Richard Parker's Growth
    
    Richard Parker, another one of the main characters of the story, grows and develops alongside Pi, although less subtly.
    
    As the story progresses, Richard Parker becomes more friendly with Pi and gains a respect for him as an "alpha animal." Like Pi, Richard Parker grows to accept the conditions around him and does not give up on living.
    
    By the end of the story, Richard Parker runs into the jungle, never to be seen by Pi again, but he does not leave as the same tiger. Richard Parker leaves Pi having lost everything yet starting anew, stronger than ever.

** Conflict Development
   
   At the beginning of the story, Pi lives out his life rather peacefully.

   The first minor conflict for him would be his unusual name, garnering him a somewhat unpleasant reputation at school. This type of conflict aligns with a more typical youth novel.
   
   The second minor conflict Pi experiences is his parents' and others' aversion to Pi believing in three religions, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam.
   
   These two conflicts are "man versus society" type conflicts.
   
   Finally, the last conflict that Pi faces in the early parts of the book is dealing with the thought of moving to Canada, a far away country. This conflict aligns more towards "man versus self" in dealing with emotions and "man versus man" in that his parents are the cause of the conflict.
   
   The real main conflict starts, quite obviously, with the sinking of the /Tsimtsum/ and the Pi's harsh striving on the lifeboat. This entire quest is an example of "man versus nature" as Pi fights to survive Richard Parker, the climate, starvation, and dehydration.
   
** Symbolism

   Despite supposedly being a real story, /The Life of Pi/ does contain some symbolism.
   
   In fact, one outright example of symbolism is the made-up story that Pi tells the two interviewers at the end of the book. Pi projects the animals on the boat onto people in this false story. Pi symbolizes Richard Parker's mean, ferocious appearance as an evil, cannibalistic cook. The zebra with the broken leg represents the sailor, who also had a broken leg. The hyena who, for a time at least, coexisted with the tiger represents Pi's mother.
   
   Another great example of symbolism appears with Pi's encounter of the algae island. In my opinion, the algae island represents something of a false paradise, akin to a mirage oasis in a desert, although slightly different. Pi is miraculously saved by the island, but he soon finds that not everything is as it seems.
   
   Another good way to look at the algae island is to view it as a materialization of complacency. As Pi lives some days on the island, he is forced to confront the decision of whether or not he should leave. After seeing the remains of a dead human, however, Pi is reminded of the dangers of not moving on. Pi ponders what kind of life that person must have lived through, how lonely it must have been to waste away until their death.
   
   Before it is destroyed, the raft symbolizes a safe haven or a home for Pi. Pi is separated from Richard Parker, has shelter, and is free to carry on whatever he wants to do without any obstruction. On the raft, he eats; on the raft, he sleeps.

** Critical Thinking
   
   Some possible questions to have in mind.
   
   - How does religion affect Pi's view of the world and help him on the lifeboat?
   - How does Pi grow as a character throughout the story?
   - Why do you believe Yann Martel, the author, included parts of Pi's early life before the sinking of the /Tsimtsum/?
   - Why do you believe Yann Martel chose to intersperse parts of Pi's future as an adult as the story progressed?
   - What is the significance of the interview at the end of the story?
   - Why do you believe the author chose to write chapters of such varying length?

** Thoughts

   Overall, I actually quite enjoyed the book, and I feel that this was a nice opportunity to finally read and analyze the classic story that I had only vaguely heard of. Although some parts, such as the introduction, did drag on, I found that the short chapters helped to keep my attention and interest me.
   
   In my opinion, a lot of this book seems to feel like a "love letter to God." Although not stated outright, the story seems to flow in a beautiful way that really focuses on Pi's love for religion and how it impacted his life.
   
   The book is very philosophical and psychological at times, understandably so, due to just how emotionally moving and changing Pi's situation is. It is clear that Pi spent a lot of his time thinking and reflecting on the state he is in.
   
   /Do I think that the story really is real?/ To be honest, it is really hard for me to say. I know quite little about the behavior of animals and the legitimacy of a carnivorous, so I cannot comment on that part. However, even though the purely logical side of me is saying that a tale so coincidental and miraculous is statistically very unlikely, another part of me cannot shake the feeling that it would not necessarily be impossible. Whatever the case, the lesson that the book carries is powerful and is, for me, the most important takeaway from this book.
   
Do not lose hope.
