\subsection{Chapter 129}

This chapter details another conversation between Pip and Ahab. Ahab sees his
madness too far alike in Pip and pushes him farther away (leaving him in the
cabin to be specific), lest he be cured somehow. Ahab doesn't want to be cured,
and thinks of his madness as what keeps him alive rather.

Pip himself certainly does seem to have gone mad. He detaches himself from his
own personality, speaking in third person as if Pip was another person and
calling him a coward. In this way, Pip somewhat rejects himself and seems to be
grown out of old self, perhaps due in part to the ways of Ahab.
