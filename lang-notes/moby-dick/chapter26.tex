\subsection{Chapter 26}

Ishmael speaks of the stoicism of Starbuck, the chief mate of the Pequod. He
talks about how Starbuck is a smart man, seeing courage as a necessary tool but
not something to blindly use. Ishmael also potentially alludes to some
spiritual troubles that Starbuck faces and how they are the one thing he might
truly fear.
