\subsection{Chapter 34}

Ishmael talks of the dining situation in the cabin. Ahab first enters, then
Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask follow in that order. Ishmael points out the at
first odd domesticness of the other officers at the dining table, but explains
how Ahab, although never demanding anything, socially owns and is the master of
the table. They then leave in reverse order and the harpooners enter, eating
with a far more open mood (they also harass Dough-Boy this is so sad).

Ishmael then talks about how the cabin is very infrequently visited by everyone
due in part to Ahab's anti-social presence, and most people simply enter the
cabin to get to their sleeping quarters.
