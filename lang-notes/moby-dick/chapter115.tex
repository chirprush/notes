\subsection{Chapter 115}

The Pequod crosses paths with a ship called the Bachelor, which was very
successful on its whaling journey. The captain invites Ahab aboard, but not
having any information on Moby Dick, Ahab refuses.

At the end of the chapter, Ahab takes out a vial of sand, perhaps as a way of
remembering his home of Nantucket. Does Ahab know whether or not he will die?
