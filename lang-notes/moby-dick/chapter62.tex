\subsection{Chapter 62}

Ishmael describes the process of the chase: rowing and then darting the whale.
Ishmael talks about how the harpooner must first row with all their might
towards the whale, all while yelling and having their back towards it, and then
they must turn around and throw the dart as hard as they can. Only after this
do they switch places with the headsman. Ishmael laments this strategy, as
often the harpooner is far too exhausted, which he believes to be the cause of
many fishery failures. He wants harpooners to not have to row, as it is not the
speed of the whale that often causes misses in the whaling business.
