\subsection{Chapter 93}

One of the oarsmen sprains their hand, leaving Pip (a rather timid, weak boy)
to substitute in for him. Upon the first encounter with a whale, Pip jumps out
and gets tangled in the line. This forces Tashtego to cut the line, and the
whale is lost in the process. Pip is scolded and told not to jump out of the
boat, but the next time he does quite the same, except he does not get tangled.
He is left at sea by Stubb, who thought that the other boats might pick up him
up, but they did not. Only by chance did the ship save Pip, who seems to have
gone mad because of his abandonment experience at sea. According to Ishmael,
this is common in whaling, and it even happened to him.
