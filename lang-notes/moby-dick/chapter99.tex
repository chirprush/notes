\subsection{Chapter 99}

This chapter explores the different views the crewmates have on the golden
doubloon (the one Ahab promised to give to the one who slays Moby Dick).
Notably, Ahab sees himself in it, Starbuck sees it as a sign of goodness, and
Pip sees it as a sign of the demise of everyone.
