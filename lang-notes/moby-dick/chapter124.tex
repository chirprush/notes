\subsection{Chapter 124}

Due to the electricity of the thunderstorm, the compasses of the Pequod are
inverted, which is noticed by Ahab. Ahab then constructs a new makeshift
compass using a few materials, awing some of the crew.

In this chapter, the officers act rather meekly, which is just a bit
uncharacteristic of them. Perhaps they have all truly realized their fate and
yet are none to stop Ahab?

Just like previous texts we have read (the Iliad/Aeneid) pride plays a big part
in this story as well. It is precisely this "fatal pride" of Ahab that will
lead to the demise of the Pequod. In addition, however, we see once again that
fate too plays a role in this story.
