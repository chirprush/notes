\subsection{Chapter 88}

Ishmael talks about the two types of schools of whales one might see when
whaling. Firstly there are the female schools, also known as the harems, where
there is one large male whale/lord/schoolmaster defending the group and many
female whales. Secondly there are the male schools, where there are only males.
As time passes, whales from the male schools will go to become lords, and the
lord whales from the female schools will roam for the rest of their lives
alone. When a whale is struck in a female school, other whales crowd around the
struck whale, potentially becoming easier to hunt; whereas, for male schools
there is no shared empathy between them.
