\subsection{Chapter 3}

Stepping into the Spouter-Inn, Ishmael finds himself an eccentric looking
place, fitted with an equally eccentric painting and landlord. When Ishmael
attempts to get a room, he is told that all the rooms are filled, and that he
will have to share a bed with a harpooner. While hesitant, Ishmael agrees to
this and obliges for supper. While at the bar, a rowdy bunch enters, and
Ishmael points out one character who will later become is ship-mate.

As the night approaches closer and closer, Ishmael begins to seriously
question whether or not this supposed harpooner is an all right man to be
sleeping with, and decides to try and sleep on a bench. After realizing that he
will freeze if he tries, Ishmael is left with no other choice. Ishmael asks
the landlord what kind of person this harpooner is (and why he isn't back at
12:00 AM), and is confused by what the landlord says. Ishmael ends up taking
the bed anyways and is woken up by the harpooner, who he observes for a while.
Ishmael is bewildered by his selling of human heads (O\_O) and nightly ritual,
and he is almost attacked, but the landlord is called, and the situation is
sorted. Ishmael feels a little bad for making so many assumptions about this
man, Queequeg, when he was really just another person.
