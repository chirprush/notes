\subsection{Chapter 23}

Ishmael notices Bulkington, a man from the inn quite previously ago, is on the
ship and talks about him in a sort of meta sense.

I'm not quite sure what to make of this chapter and the wording used. On one
hand, I can certainly see the analogy Melville/Ishmael is using to describe how
it seems Bulkington is adverse to staying on land (departing on another long
journey after just having gotten back from a new one), but there are also hints
of foreshadowing, especially with how Melville writes: "this six-inch chapter
is the stoneless grave of Bulkington" (Melville 94). Melville's analogy is also
somewhat worrying as it talks about a ship crashing into the land from which it
sailed. It seems quite likely that the ship will crash in the future of the
book, and many might be lost.
