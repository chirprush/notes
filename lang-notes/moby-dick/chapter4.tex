\subsection{Chapter 4}

Ishmael wakes up to Queequeg hugging him, which reminds him of a somewhat
dream from his early childhood. Ishmael then watches Queequeg get dressed,
going into particularly detail of how foreign and "savage" it is to him, but
forgets to say no homo.

It seems particularly apparent, due in large part due to when this was written
I suppose, that there are some elements of white superiority and racism
involved in describing Queequeg, portraying him as a somewhat stereotypical
"savage" islander.
