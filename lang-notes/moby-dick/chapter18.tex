\subsection{Chapter 18}

Ishmael introduces Queequeg to the two owners of the Pequod, and at first they
are furious, "not wanting a cannibal to step foot on the ship." Ishmael does
some negotiating, and Queequeg shows off his skills, and this convinces Peleg
(who gives Queequeg the ninetieth lay) but not Bildad, who is still hung up
about how Queequeg is not a devout Christian. Regardless, the papers are
signed, and Queequeg joins the crew.
