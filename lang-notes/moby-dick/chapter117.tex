\subsection{Chapter 117}

Ahab wakes up at night to the footsteps of Fedallah, who has a prophecy.
Fedallah claims that only when Ahab sees two hearses (like funeral thingies) at
sea, one made with American wood, will he die, and that only hemp will be the
reason he dies (perhaps something similar to what was mentioned in previous
chapters with one being wrapped around in their own whaling boat line?). In
addition, Fedallah will die before Ahab.

Ahab is not totally believing of this, vowing that he will slay Moby Dick and live, and that he is immortal at sea.
