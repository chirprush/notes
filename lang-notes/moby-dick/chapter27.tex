\subsection{Chapter 27}

Ishmael describes the other two main chiefs: Stubb (a man indifferent to many
things likely because of how much he smokes), and Flask (a small,
whale-bloodthirsty man). Each of the three captains chooses a harpooner for
themselves. Starbuck chooses Queequeg, Stubb chooses Tashtego (a Native
American), and Flask chooses Daggoo (a very tall African man).

Ishmael then describes how many of the other crew are islanders, with the white
man being leaders and the other people merely providing muscle.
