\subsection{Chapter 73}

Surprisingly, Ahab makes the order that a right whale should be hunted if the
opportunity arises. After a bit of time, one is spotted, and Stubb and Flask
slay it. There, they converse about how Ahab wants this to balance the ship in
some superstitious sense and how Fedallah is the devil is disguise. Flask is in
the end right about the head being put on the other side of the ship.
