\subsection{Chapter 42}

Ishmael ponders quite deeply over the idea of whiteness and how some find it to
be greatly associated with regality and divineness, but in the world of
whaling, it is associated with great fear with regards to perhaps rocky waters
as well as the great Albino whale.

To be honest, I didn't get a lot of this chapter (a lot of comparisons were
made, so I guess it's not really a whole lot content wise just analysis that I
should probably do sometime), so I might have to go back to it when I'm less
distracted.
