\subsection{Chapter 21}

It is the early morning before the Pequod is scheduled to embark, and Ishmael
sees shadows moving in the mist. Queequeg and him try to follow, but they are
stopped by Elijah who is probably smoking crack again. Elijah once again gives
his acid trip premonition and then stubbornly tries to stop the two from going.
Ishmael and Queequeg then again hurry in the direction of the shadows but don't
see anyone besides a sleeping man. People gradually begin to wake up and last
minute work starts while Ishmael is told that Captain Ahab supposedly arrived
in his cabin last night.
