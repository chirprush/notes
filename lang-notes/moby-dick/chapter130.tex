\subsection{Chapter 130}

Now finally in the last stretch of finding Moby Dick, the crew has all gone
mostly silent under the constant pressure and surveillance of Ahab. Ahab and
Fedallah share but few words, but there seems to be something connecting them.

Ahab, distrusting some of the crew (even the officers) as to whether they would
actually point out Moby Dick if it were to be spotted, asks that he himself be
put up at the mast head. In order to do this, whalers must rely on someone
attentive to hold the rope so that they stay there without falling into sea.
For this task, Ahab chooses none other than Starbuck, the person who most
directly opposes him. This raises an interesting question: did Ahab know that
Starbuck already refused a chance to kill him that one day with the musket?

At the end of the chapter, a bird takes Ahab's hat. Ishmael alludes to a
similar story of how a man named Tarquin become the emperor of Rome after this
happened, but only after the bird returned his hat to him. Ahab's hat was not
returned. This is likely more blatant foreshadowing of what's to come.
