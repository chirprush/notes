\subsection{Chapter 12}

Queequeg tells the story of his home island Kokovoko and his royal upbringing.
At a young age, Queequeg had a fascination with Christianity and secretly
hitched aride, escaping his homeland, to learn more about it and experience the
Western world. After realizing that Christianity was not the pure thing he once
thought, Queequeg felt a bit distraught and picked up whaling. Queequeg intends
to return to his island sometime in the future to be coronated, but for now
desires to travel the seas and go whaling. Ishmael mentions where he is going
next and the two vow to travel and whale together.
