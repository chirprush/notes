\subsection{Chapter 48}

As a group of whales are spotted, Ahab reveals that he had been hiding five
other people, whom Starbuck suspects are primarily to help slay Moby Dick.
After a brief moment of surprise at this, the leaders make orders to lower the
boats. Ishmael and Queequeg are on Starbuck's boat. Queequeg attempts to attack
the whale, but he is unable to hit it and they are for a moment lost in the
mist at sea, with the whale having capsized the boat. They then wait a few
hours to hear that the Pequod approaching them. They get on the Pequod and see
the boat knocked away.
