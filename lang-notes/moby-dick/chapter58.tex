\subsection{Chapter 58}

The Pequod now passes through a wide expanse of brit, the miniscule food of the
Right Whale, and they do encounter several groups of Right Whales.

Ishmael then goes to talk about some of the severe differences between that
which you can find on land versus on sea. Certainly, the sea is far more
unforgiving to all forms of life, and all animals are eternally at war with
each other.

One particular subsection I liked was how Ishmael mentioned that, regardless of
how much man develops technology, the sea is still unforgiving and it will try
its best to destroy you. This is unfortunately still the case even to this day.
