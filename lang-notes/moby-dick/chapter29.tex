\subsection{Chapter 29}

Ahab usually doesn't patrol at nights because he does not want to wake the crew
with his stride, but one day he forgets of this and paces in the middle of the
night. This wakes up Stubb who tells him to shut up, and in response Ahab tells
him to go away with some not very PG-13 words. Stubb then goes away after a
bit, but has a hissy fit (he kinda goes on a whole malding spree) because no
one's ever talked to him like that. Poor Stubb :pensive:. Dough Boy!
