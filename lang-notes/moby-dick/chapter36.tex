\subsection{Chapter 36}

Ahab calls everyone to assembly and announces that he is offering a golden coin
to anyone who can kill a great, white whale. He even goes to say that the
purpose of this trip is to defeat it. The harpooners mention that this sounds
like a whale named Moby Dick. This exclamation ignites the crew, except for
Starbuck who thinks that Ahab has gone mad with vengance. Ahab then passes on a
goblet to everyone, especially the harpooners, to make sure that they pledge
their willingness.
