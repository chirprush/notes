\subsection{Chapter 13}

Ishmael and Queequeg finally set sail together on a boat called the Moss. This
chapter mainly focuses on how Queequeg and the relationship between him and
Ishmael is viewed by the people. Queequeg tells a story of how he didn't know
how to use a wheelbarrow to carry his stuff, but also goes on to tell a story
of how a captain came to his island and unknowingly dishonored customs,
highlighting that every place is unique and works differently. As they begin to
sail on the Moss, one boy makes fun of Queequeg. In response, Queequeg yeets
him up into the air, causing the captain to get angry. The boat then
experiences turbulence, and the small boy gets swept off the boat. In absolute
r/thathappened fashion, Queequeg saves the day, fixing the boat stuff and then
diving into the water to retrieve the boy. Yes; everyone clapped, and the
captain apologized.
