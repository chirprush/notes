\subsection{Chapter 28}

Ishmael once again talks about how his subconscious worries for Captain Ahab.
One day, however, Captain Ahab finally appears from out of his cabin, and
Ishmael is struck by his burnt (?) appearance with a lightning like caused
symbol going down his face and potentially his body. Ishmael notes the ivory
leg Ahab has and how, as the weather warms up and became less cloudly, Ahab
gradually becomes less of a recluse and cheers up.
