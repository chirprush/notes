\subsection{Chapter 125}

With his quadrant broken and needles thrown off by lightning, Ahab goes to the
log and the line for ship navigation. One of the sailors points out that the
line is too frayed and rotten, likely to snap, but Ahab carries on. When the
line does snap, Ahab merely asks it to be mended.

After this, Pip comes along seemingly quite mad in the head. Ahab treats him
not as a pest, but rather welcomes him in open arms to his cabin, talking of
how they share so much.

When referring to Pip, Ahab talks about how the heavens are so ignorant to the
struggles of man. With this, Ahab almost seems to be directly opposing the gods
and the heavens. This is quite evident in how he seems to be rejecting fate and
making himself out to be his own sort of lord or god.
