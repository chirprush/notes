\subsection{Chapter 133}

The Pequod finally encounters Moby Dick. Ahab claims the doubloon temporarily,
and they give chase. Two boats are destroyed in the ensuing fight, and no
damage is dealt to Moby Dick. The whale picks up speed, and the boats are left
no choice but to return to the Pequod and give chase behind. As night falls,
the crew can no longer see the spout, and so they travel in the general
direction of the whale.
