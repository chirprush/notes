\subsection{Chapter 11}

Ishmael lies in bed with Queequeg speaking of the wonders of contrasts and
human warmth. Queequeg then begins to tell stories of his homeland.

One could make the connection between Ishmael's talk of extreme opposites and
contrasts of someone having to be cold to enjoy human warmth with the previous
sermon on how doing what God asks of one is hard (okay the idea sounds weird
when written out this way but the connection is there I just don't know how to
express it well).
