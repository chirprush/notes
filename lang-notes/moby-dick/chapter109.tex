\subsection{Chapter 109}

A leak has been found in the oil casks. Starbuck reports to Ahab asking
to make the preparations to fix the leak (which will take some time); however,
Ahab impatiently wants to make it to the Japanese fishing ground (where Moby
Dick previously battled him), and so he refuses. Surprised and slightly
infuriated, Starbuck tries his best to persuade Ahab, but Ahab refuses and even
pulls a gun on Starbuck, who questioned his authority. Starbuck tells Ahab to
be not afraid of him but rather himself. While, his fiery attitude does not
calm down nonetheless, Ahab relents and gives the order to fix the leak, which
is somewhat uncharacteristic of him.

An interesting comparision is made by Ahab, where he describes that "[t]here is
one God that is Lord over the earth, and one Captain that is lord over the
Pequod" (Melville 379). In this way, Ahab shows his true madness and power
hunger, for he is almost comparing himself to a god or someone far above any
one of the crew.
