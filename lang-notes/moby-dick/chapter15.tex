\subsection{Chapter 15}

By recommendation of the landlord of the Spouter-Inn, Ishmael and Queequeg seek
out an inn by the name of Try Pots. Ishmael is struck by the delicious food,
all being chowder, but quickly realizes that there's simply too many clams and
cods, such that even the milk tastes a bit fishy. Before going to sleep, the
landlord insists that Queequeg cannot take his harpoons to bed.
