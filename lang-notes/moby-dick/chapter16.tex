\subsection{Chapter 16}

Queequeg, by suggestion of his God, Yojo, insists that Ishmael makes the
decision of which ship to board to go whaling on. With some self-doubt, Ishmael
goes out and chooses the Pequod. On the Pequod, Ishmael meets the principal
owners: retired Captains Peleg and Bildad. They are both Quakers, but Peleg is
far more carefree and loose, while Bildad is certainly more stern and strict.
Peleg offers the three hundredth lay for Ishmael (the three hundredth share of
the war spoils), but Bildad wants to only give him the seven hundred seventy
seventh lay. Ishmael ends up signing the papers for the three hundredth lay and
states that he will bring Queequeg the next day. Ishmael also inquires about
the captain of the voyage, Captain Ahab, to which Peleg speaks well of him, if
describing him as a bit moody due to losing a leg.
