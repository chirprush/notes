\subsection{Chapter 90}

In somewhat of a criticism of the law, Ishmael describes an English law in
which the head and tail of any whale captured near English shores must go to
the royalty. Ishmael talks of a story in which some poor mariners had this
happen to them and their spoils were taken by the rich lord despite all
begging.
