\subsection{Chapter 132}

Given the fair weather and sun on this day, Ahab becomes a bit sentimental,
thinking about his family and how far his whaling journey has come. Starbuck
tries to use this (while also talking about his own family) to convince Ahab
to stop going so vehemently after Moby Dick, but this doesn't work. Ahab
believes it to be his unstoppable fate to try (and perhaps fail) to slay Moby
Dick.
