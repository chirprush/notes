\subsection{Chapter 50}

Ishmael talks about how some captains do get on boats while hunting whales,
while others do not. Following this, he explains how Ahab's position is a bit
special, given the condition of his leg. Normally, Ahab wouldn't go on a boat
for any other reason but to possibly give commands, and so he wasn't specially
given a boat. Despite this, however, Ahab planned carefully to be able to pull
this off.

Ishmael then goes to talk about the five mysterious men on the boat and how the
excitement about them faded quickly among the crew, perhaps such a thing being
a rather common sight. However, Ishmael does point out that one cannot simply
ignore Fedallah, who potentially might have some control over Ahab.
