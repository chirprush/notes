\subsection{Chapter 89}

Sometimes one may lose a whale due to a slipping or a storm, leading to legal
ambiguity as to who owns it when say another ship catches this whale. Ishmael
explains the reasonably widely accepted rules of whaling in these cases.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.
    \item A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.
\end{enumerate}
In this case, fast means in the sense of fishing lines I believe. In short, if
there's any show of possession and intent to keep the whale, it belongs to that
party; else, it is free for the taking.

Ishmael demonstrates this with a specific legal case and then beings to relate
this phrase of Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish to life and humanity itself.
