\subsection{Chapter 71}

The stranger ship turns out to be a ship called the Jeroboam. The crew has an
epidemic, so the ship only gets a safe distance to the Pequod. In addition, a
crazy man claiming to be the archangel Gabriel is on the boat, shrieking and
having a decent bit of control over the crew. Ahab asks about Moby Dick,
prompting the Jeroboam's captain to tell a story of how a single man died to
him. Ahab also tries to hand over a letter for the man who died, but Gabriel
manages to throw it back.

This Gabriel also sort of curses Ahab in his journey to hunt Moby Dick, much
like Elijah and many others. The omens and foreshadowing are ever increasing.
