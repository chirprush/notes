\subsection{Chapter 59}

Daggoo sees a white mass rising up in the distance and signals that the White
Whale has come. Everyone prepares to fight, but it turns out that it was a
large squid. In whaling experience, this seems to be a quite rare and perhaps
auspicious (in a good or bad way I'm not certain) event. Ishmael also talks about how squid are perhaps the food for sperm whales.

Ahab in particular is quite excited when he first hears this, but when
realizing that it is not Moby Dick, he turns back silently.
