\subsection{Chapter 81}

The Pequod encounters a German ship by the name of the Jungfrau, which is out
of oil. Somewhat begrudgingly, the Pequod fills their oil canister. A perhaps
sickly sperm whale is spotted in the distance, and the two ships each set out
boats to give chase to this whale. The Jungfrau, being slightly ahead, taunts
the Pequod, much to the fury of the officers. Channeling this frustration, the
Pequod's boats overtake the Jungfrau's, and the crew slays the sperm whale.
Unfortunately, the carcass sinks. The Jungfrau then chases after a type of
whale that looks like a sperm whale, but to an experienced whaler is certainly
not one.
