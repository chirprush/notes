\subsection{Chapter 20}

This chapter details all the preparation needed before the Pequod sets sail.
People build and repair the ship, while others stock the necessary materials
for whaling and general ship life. Ishmael points out that when it comes to
whaling especially, many of the things that the crew's livelihood rests upon
are quiteu easily lost or destroyed at seatime, so it makes sense to take
extras (of which Bildad's sister provided many of). Every day, Ishmael and
Queequeg made the visit to the Pequod to see the general look of things and how
they were progressing. Ishmael continues to ask questions about Captain Ahab,
but is told nothing more than he already knows.

There is some quite direct foreshadowing with how Ishmael tries to blot out his
concerns about Captain Ahab (and not having seen him once) out of his mind.
