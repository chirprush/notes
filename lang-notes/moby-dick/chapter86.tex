\subsection{Chapter 86}

Ishmael talks about the beauty of the tail of the whale, listing its five major
purposes and describing its elegance. Several comparisons between the whale and
the elephant are made in terms of how functionally similar the tail and the
trunk respectively are as well as the holiness of both animals. At the end of
the chapter, Ishmael once again relates this back to the entire body, saying
that he knows only so much about the tail that he cannot begin to know about
the head nor the face. The chapter ends with the assertment that the whale has
no face (perhaps for analysis try to think about what the whale symbolically
even represents).
