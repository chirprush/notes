\subsection{Chapter 32}

Ishmael/Melville---the distinction isn't perhaps as clear because the speaker
does mention Moby Dick as "this book" (Melville 123), but that could simply be
Ishmael's perspective as if he's writing this book---goes on a rather long talk
about the classification of whales and his own personal system for them based
on size. Ishmael separates whales into the Folio, the Octavo, and the
Duodecimo. I won't go too much into detail of each specific whale because I
hardly think that's relevant. All that is needed to be known is that the Sperm
Whale is the Leviathan of the sea (the biggest) and what every whaler wants to
get their hands on. The Right Whale is also worth mentioning, but is not as
significant.
