\subsection{Chapter 135}

As the third day of the chase ensues, Starbuck begins to see a grim fate lying
ahead of him. Ahab drops his boat to go attack Moby Dick, only to see that
Fedallah is caught on the whale with the previous day's line. This fulfills the
first hearse of Fedallah's prophecy. Seeing the whale grow slower, Ahab
harpoons it once, but the line breaks. The whale then wheels around to attack
the Pequod. The officers of the Pequod contemplate their deaths in that moment.
Seeing the whale charge the Pequod, Ahab realizes the second hearse, the one of
American wood, has been fulfilled as well. Ahab tries to harpoon the whale in
the last second to save the ship, but he does not realize that the line is
running out. Thus, it catches his neck and flings him into the depths of the
ocean, fulfilling the prophecy of the hemp being his death. As the whale hits
the Pequod, it sinks, but not before Tashtego nails a bird to the mast, an
allusion to the devil taking "a living part of heaven along" (Melville 452).

In the epilogue, we learn that Ishmael was actually on Ahab's whaling boat, and
was the sole survivor, making his way along to the coffin buoy and being
rescued by the Rachel in its search for the missing children.

I'll miss Queequeg so much.
