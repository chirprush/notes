\subsection{Chapter 131}

The Pequod meets a ship called the Delight which lost five men recently to Moby
Dick. Ahab claims that he will slay the whale, but the captain of the Delight
tells him that it is a suicide mission.

As the Pequod leaves, the Delight's captain remarks how the coffin of the
Pequod is already shown.
