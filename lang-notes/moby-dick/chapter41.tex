\subsection{Chapter 41}

Ishmael admits that he too vowed to take down Moby Dick. He then goes into
detail about the rumours surrounding Moby Dick and other sperm whales, some
supernatural and some not. Ishmael goes in depth explaining how perfectly Ahab
hid his madness and fury for revenge under the guise of grief until he gained
the position of captain and an outlet for his vengeance. Ishmael even remarks
how well picked the crew was for such an otherwise traitorous task: none of the
officers standing up to Ahab and much of the crew being fully supportive and
bloodthirsty towards whales.

This chapter in my opinion is quite beautiful, especially when talking about
the madness lying deep within Ahab.
