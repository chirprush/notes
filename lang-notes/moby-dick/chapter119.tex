\subsection{Chapter 119}

The Pequod encounters a rough storm, with the sail canvas even being blown off.
While hearing the thunder, the sailors look up to see the corposants (plasma at

Ahab's harpoon starts catching on fire, which Starbuck takes to be a sign that
God is against his mission to slay Moby Dick. This instills fear into the crew,
what Ahab feared Starbuck might do some day.
