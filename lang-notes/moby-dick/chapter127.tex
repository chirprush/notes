\subsection{Chapter 127}

Ahab, seeing the life-buoy coffin, is rather displeased. He starts talking
about the sound a coffin makes when it is rung (I don't really understand this
chapter all too much to be completely honest).

In addition, we see more hints of Ahab interacting with Pip, likely to show how
Ahab has been cultivating another person of madness.
