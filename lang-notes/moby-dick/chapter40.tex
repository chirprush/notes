\subsection{Chapter 40}

The crew is, for the most part, drunk and celebrating around. They dance and
cheer and have fun, but a few stragglers, such as Pip, seem unhappy with this.
A spanish sailor says some no no racist stuff to Dagoo, and a small fight
breaks out, but it is quickly stopped as people have to man their positions.
Pip in particular is worried about those who have been riled up by Captain Ahab
and wishes that they wouldn't blindly charge after Moby Dick.
