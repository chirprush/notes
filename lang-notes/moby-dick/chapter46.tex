\subsection{Chapter 46}

This chapter describes the delicate balancing act Ahab must play with his
vengeance towards Moby Dick and his job. Ahab must be careful not to allow any
uprisings from Starbuck and the crew, having to entertaining them with lesser
beasts along the way. Because of this, Ahab cannot with reckless abandon chase
after Moby Dick, but instead continue on the journey of the Pequod while
calculatingly planning his next moves.
