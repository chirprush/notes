\subsection{Chapter 123}

The wind clears up and the sails are repaired. Starbuck goes down to Ahab's
cabin to inform him of this, but he is sleeping. Starbuck sees the musket on
the wall and wrestles with himself on whether or not to shoot Ahab. If he does,
he might be able to see his family again. If he doesn't, who knows what fate
will befall him? Despite this, he doesn't shoot in the end.
