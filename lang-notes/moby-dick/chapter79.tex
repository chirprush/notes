\subsection{Chapter 79}

Ishmael details the physiognomy of the sperm whale, describing its countenance
and how far from a human it is. This, to Ishmael, adds to the beauty and
dignity of the whale's stature, and even goes as far to call the whale wise,
not speaking and with a face certainly hard to read.
