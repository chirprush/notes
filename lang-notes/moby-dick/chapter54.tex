\subsection{Chapter 54}

The Pequod ran into another ship called the Town-Ho and had a gam with it,
leading to Ishmael telling a quite long story about some drama revolving around
the ship and its crew. In short essence, two crew members, Radney and
Steelkilt, had quite the feud, even so much leading to a whole mutiny.
Fast-forwarding, they spotted Moby Dick and, in chasing it, Radney was eaten,
and Steelkilt deserted.

In my opinion, what's of most importance is Moby Dick's appearance, signaling
that he truly is close. There is no doubt in my mind that Ahab will take this
news with great interest, to say the least.
