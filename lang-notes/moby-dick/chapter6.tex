\subsection{Chapter 6}

Ishmael, on his walk presumably, describes the town of New Bedford. He points
out the foreigners from all places of the world and how odd one finds them all.
He points out the inexperienced young men who have come from the country to
make quick money whaling. Despite all this criticism of the town's people,
Ishmael does point out the true beauty of the town with the gardens, lights
(aided by the whale oil), and women.
