\subsection{Chapter 5}

Ishmael goes down to eat breakfast and takes a look at the crew that arrived
last night. He points out how all of them are quite interestingly almost
embarassed and quiet during breakfast, despite being such powerful men at sea.
Ishmael also points out how Queequeg stands out from the crowd, having brought
his harpoon.

At the end of the chapter, Ishmael tells the reader that he goes out for a
walk.
