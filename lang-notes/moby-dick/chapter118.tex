\subsection{Chapter 118}

In calculating the position of the ship to know whether to face towards the
equator, Ahab curses science for not being able to tell him where Moby Dick is
at this moment. In addition, Fedallah supposedly senses good prospects for Ahab
yet fatal ones for himself. Stubb curses Ahab to death.
