\subsection{Chapter 126}

As the Pequod is sailing, screams are heard in the distance, which Ahab claims
to be seals, although they sound like people. Later that night, a sailor does
fall into sea. This warrants the construction of a new, lighter life-buoy.
Starbuck asks the carpenter to make Queequeg's coffin into a life-buoy (a bit
of twisted irony), which he reluctantly obliges to. He puts on thirty lines, so
that thirty people will be fighting over the buoy should the ship go down.
