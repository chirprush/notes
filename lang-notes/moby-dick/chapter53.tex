\subsection{Chapter 53}

Ishmael talks about how usually when whaling ships meet each other, they have a
gam, or they board eachother's ships and be amiable for a while. Ishmael
contrasts this to other professions over the sea, also slipping into a rant
about how only whaling captains do not laze around.

I'm not quite able to understand the analogy Ishmael is trying to make in the
end of the first page of the chapter addressing why the two ships in this case
didn't gam (although perhaps that's solely due to Ahab's lone fixation on
slaying Moby Dick).
