\subsection{Chapter 72}

Ishmael describes how Queequeg inserts the blubber hook while tending to the
whale. Ishmael has the duty of monkey-rope and suspending Queequeg. They are
joined together so that if either falls, they both do. Daggoo and Tashtego help
with the sharks below Queequeg, but they are also quite close to hitting him.
After Queequeg finishes this arduous task, Dough Boy hands him ginger water
(given by Aunt Charity), which upsets Stubb. Stubb goes down to get Queequeg
alcohol and throw away the ginger.
