\subsection{Chapter 64}

After Stubb slew the sperm whale, he was quite enthusiastic, and asked for
whale steak to be made. During supper, sharks began eating away at the whale
corpse attached to the ship. After a brief while, Stubb calls the cook, Fleece,
to complain that the whale steak is too well done, taking him to go preach to
the sharks outside (?) and then ordering him harvest more whale tomorrow and
cook it more wildly.
