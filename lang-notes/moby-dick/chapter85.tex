\subsection{Chapter 85}

Ishmael talks about the whalers' debate over whether the spout of the whale
releases water or mist (but they're the same thing so who cares). To do this,
Ishmael goes into explaining the respiratory system of the whale, how it can
survive while breathing so little, and the periodicity of these spouts. In the
end, however, there is no sufficient way to tell, and the spout of the whale is
thought to be poisonous, so nobody tries to confirm.
