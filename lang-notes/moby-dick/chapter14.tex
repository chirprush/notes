\subsection{Chapter 14}

The ship has now reached Nantucket. Ishmael describes the oddity of its
seclusiveness and the story of how the island was found by a Native American
family who had their child kidnapped and murdered by an eagle. Ishmael says
that those from Nantucket are all around the world and the sea is their true
home.

I'm not quite sure I understand this chapter and why Ishmael has such a
fixation with those from Nantucket. What is the deeper meaning behind what's
being said?
