\subsection{Chapter 69}

Ishmael remarks how, after being stripped of its skin, the whale is given a
most terrible funeral, its carcass being eaten by various vulturous sea
creatures. Ishmael also mentions how other ships will avoid this spot now due
to ghosts (I think that's what he was saying?).

The last couple of paragraphs offer some quite interesting commentary on
orthodoxy and tradition. Is this Ishmael rejecting the idea of ghosts and
superstition?
