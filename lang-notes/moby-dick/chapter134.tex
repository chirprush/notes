\subsection{Chapter 134}

On the second day of the chase, the Pequod loses Moby Dick for a short while,
but then it surfaces, and the boats are lowered once again. Once again some
boats are destroyed, with Stubb and Flask having to be rescued from the ocean.
Ahab has to cut his line, but darts his harpoon into the whale (at least I
think). Somewhere in this process, however, Fedallah is taken under and likely
dies (remember back to the prophecy of how Fedallah dies before Ahab). Ahab
breaks his new bone leg once again, and thus everyone retreats to the ship.

As they make preparations to continue the chase, Starbuck tries and fails once
again to persuade Ahab not to go.
