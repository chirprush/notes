\subsection{Chapter 75}

Ishmael now takes it to describe the right whale's appearance, noting whiskers,
a far more prominent tongue, blinds of bone, and two spout holes, to name a few
features. It is then stated that one of the heads will fall into the sea, and
the other shall too (perhaps along with the ship?). Ishmael notes the Stoic
expression of the right whale and the Platonian expression of the sperm whale.
