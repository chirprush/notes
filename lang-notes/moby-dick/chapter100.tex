\subsection{Chapter 100}

The Pequod encounters another ship, one with a captain whose arm has been lost
to Moby Dick. Ahab impatiently waits through their conversation before asking
where the whale has went, and then promptly leaves when they answer.

The captain of the Sammy is of the opinion that Moby Dick should not be hunted,
as he has already lost an arm. This, combined with the surgeon on board saying
that Ahab's blood is boiling, only serves to magnify the sheer madness and fury
of Ahab.
