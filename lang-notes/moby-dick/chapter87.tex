\subsection{Chapter 87}

The Pequod follows its course through the narrow straights of Sundra (passing
through Java). As it chases a school of whales, the Pequod is also chased by
Malaysian pirates, although the Pequod quickly loses them. The boats are then
dropped to go after the many whales, but in the end only a few are caught.
Ishmael does hint at the end of the chapter that the other whales were captured
by some other ship, though.
