\subsection{Chapter 108}

This chapter details the conversations between Ahab and the carpenter as the
ivory leg is being created. Ahab talks quite oddly about several matters with a
rather passive-aggressive tone towards the carpenter. Ahab talks the blacksmith
being named Prometheus, alluding to the story of the Greek Prometheus and how
as humans are made out of fire, it only suits them they should go to fire/hell.
Another part of the dialogue relates to how Ahab can still feel as though he
has two living legs, and oddly he relates it back to one (it sounded like he
was addressing the carpenter, but it very well could have been himself)
experiencing hell without a body. All in all, the carpenter finds the
conversation quite weird.
