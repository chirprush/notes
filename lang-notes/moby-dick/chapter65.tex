\subsection{Chapter 65}

Ishmael describes the many parts of a whale that are sometimes eaten. Despite
their rarity, whales are not quite seen as fine dining. They are too rich, and
perhaps too abundant in meat. What landmen particularly take most horror in,
Ishmael believes, is that they are eating the whale in the light of its own
oil. Ishmael points out the hypocrisy in this relating to even utensils being
made out of livestock parts, the same animals in the food of landmen.
