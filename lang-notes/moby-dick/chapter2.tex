\subsection{Chapter 2}

Preferring the historical significance and lesser capitalist involvement of
whaling there, Ishmael prepares to set out for Nantucket, but quickly realizes
that he will have to wait until Monday (it is currently Saturday) to depart.
Ishmael looks around for a place to spend the two nights, eliminating all of
the options that were "too jolly." After mistaking a black church for an inn,
Ishmael quickly turns emo and finds a dreary inn, the Spouter-Inn, which he
believes suits him well.

Near the end of the chapter, Ishmael uses a very vivid description of the
harsh weather outside (alluding to the Greek northeastern wind Euroclydon) and
alluding to the story of Lazarus and Dives to describe how you would die if
left alone and shivering the outside weather. \textbf{Why does Ishmael decide
to describe this so vividly?} Perhaps this is foreshadowing to possible man vs.
nature conflict in the future.
