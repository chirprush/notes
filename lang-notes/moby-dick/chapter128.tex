\subsection{Chapter 128}

The Pequod meets the ship the Rachel, and the captain claims to have spotted
MobyDick just a day ago. However, the captain wishes Ahab to help search for a
boat they lost that day, which is later stated to have the captain's son
onboard. Ahab hesitates for a slight bit (at least I think) before outrightly
refusing him and going on.
