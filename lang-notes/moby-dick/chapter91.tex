\subsection{Chapter 91}

The Pequod encounters a French ship called the Rose-Bud which picked up two
dead whales and had a massive odor. As they had a gam, Stubb was told that the
captain was very inexperienced. As such, he worked with the Rose-Bud crew to
get them to drop the whales into the ocean, feigning some business about an
illness or rather. What the Rose-Bud didn't know was that there was valuable
ambergris inside the whale, and Stubb went to retrieve it after the ship left.
