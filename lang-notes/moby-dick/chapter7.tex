\subsection{Chapter 7}

Ishmael goes to the Whaleman's Chapel, describing the place, and reads the
inscriptions and stories of those who have died. Ishmael is also surprised to
see Queequeg in the Chapel.

Ishmael talks for quite a bit how he isn't scared of death and sees it not as
some sort of evil, but a natural part of the job. Death is bliss, so people
should not grieve as heavily that their loved ones are gone.
