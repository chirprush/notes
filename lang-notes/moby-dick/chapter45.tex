\subsection{Chapter 45}

Ishmael/Melville lists out what he believes to be some very important points
for moving forward and gives great detail and credible citations for them.
Firstly, there have been whales that have escaped being attacked only to meet
their former attackers once again and die. Secondly, some whales have been so
notorious that they have been systematically hunted.

Ishmael also points out how many land men don't fully believe the true might of
the whales, and then gives credible examples of how they have decimated ships
in an almost deliberate way.
