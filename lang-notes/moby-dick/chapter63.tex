\subsection{Chapter 63}

Ishmael describes the sheathe for the harpooner darts found on the whaling
boats, called the crotch. The crotch has two darts that are tied together, in
order to allow for multiple hits on the whale. Most of the time though, this
rarely does not happen, and the second iron as it is called is usually left
dangling in the sea. Ishmael heavily forshadows that this will become a great
danger in later chapters.
