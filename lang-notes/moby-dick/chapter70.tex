\subsection{Chapter 70}

Ishmael talks about the beheading of the whale, which is supposed to happen
before the skinning. It is a intricate job that whalers are proud of. Ahab then
talks to the whale head, saying how it has seen many a things and yet talks of
none of them. A crewmate then spots a stranger ship ahead.

Ahab once again says something at the end of the chapter that I don't
understand, but it seems to be quite an important analogy. Perhaps come back to
this for analysis.
