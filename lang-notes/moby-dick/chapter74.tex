\subsection{Chapter 74}

Ishmael gives a detailed description of the cetology of the sperm whale in
comparison to the right whale, mostly descrying the head. Ishmael talks about
the vision of the whale, having eyes where humans would have ears. This means
that whales are unable to see directly in front of them; however, they
compensate by being able to focus on two disjoint images at the same time. The
mouth of the sperm whale is then detailed, with Ishmael mentioning how the
harpooners harvest the jaw and the ivory teeth.
