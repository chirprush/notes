\subsection{Chapter 101}

Ishmael talks about the famous whaling house made in name of Samuel Enderby as
well as the previous chapter's ship of the same name. He then goes into detail
about how jolly the English and Danish whalers are, with high supplies of food
and alcohol on their ships.

This chapter is called the decanter, and the last sentence of the chapter is
"And this empties the decanter"; however, he never explicitly mentions any
decanting going on. This implies a more symbolic meaning. Perhaps, like in
decanting, Ishmael is saying that one should get everything they can out of
whaling?
