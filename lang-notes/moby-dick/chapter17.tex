\subsection{Chapter 17}

Ishmael is of the opinion that Christians should not try to argue for others,
pagans, to change their beliefs, as arguing and such wouldn't change anything
(although Ishmael certainly made true that he feels the other beliefs are
entirely false).

Queequeg is practicing Ramadan or fasting in some form where he sits on the
floor in complete silence and disregard to everything around him. Ishmael, not
knowing of this and only seeing harpoons in the room and the door being locked,
misunderstands, causing a commotion that Queequeg might have had a stroke and
trying to break into the room. When Ishmael finally does get into the room, he
realizes that Queequeg is still in his fasting.

When Queequeg stops fasting the next day, Ishmael launches into a speech about
how Queequeg shouldn't follow a religion that is so innately harmful to
himself, but Queequeg only gives Ishmael a somewhat condescending look.
