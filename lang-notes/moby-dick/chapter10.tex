\subsection{Chapter 10}

Ishmael sees Queequeg sitting alone, flipping through a book, and ponders his
situation for a moment. Ishmael is fascinated how unsocial Queequeg is being
so far away from home and how perhaps he is actually quite pure at heart for a
cannibal. Ishmael goes over to him and helps him understand the book, leading
to the two having a chat and sharing a smoke. They quickly become close
friends, with Queequeg even saying that they are "bosom friends," meaning that
he would die for Ishmael if need be. Queequeg gives Ishmael some money, and
Ishmael (after some deliberation about what it means to worship and honor God)
assists Queequeg in his ritual. The two said yes homo and went to sleep.
